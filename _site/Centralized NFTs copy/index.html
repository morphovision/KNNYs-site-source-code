    Well, you can also call me Adrian, I'm from Spain, Madrid, I'm a 3D artist, although I also control traditional painting because I love to experiment. I try to represent sensations, moments and philosophical ideas in abstractions of dark tendency, science fiction and futuristic.
        
    What do I like? I love all kinds of music, mostly dark techno is one of my favourites along with rap, I think it's very connected to art. I love skateboarding (I don't do much anymore since I fell heavily), and I love dystopian movies and books like Black Mirror, 1984, Clockwork Orange, Exist Z...
    
    The central axis of my works are living beings, nature and the complexity of neural networks, proposing scenarios that share their concern about how we will face new technological discoveries in the future.
    
    Morpho is- a combining form meaning "form, structure,"
    The structures I create are mostly based on things we know, but are difficult to identify, they are created by complex intertwining wires like neuronal branches.
    
     Morpho can be you, me and everyone.

     Love to talk and discuss about everything, so iÂ´m open to talk!
