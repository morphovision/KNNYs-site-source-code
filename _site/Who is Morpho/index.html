                <br>
                <p class="grey"><span style="color:white;"> Morpho is a 3D artist who was born and raised in Spain. His name is Adrian. He has always been interested in the arts, and he began experimenting with different mediums at a young age. He eventually discovered his talent for 3D art and decided to pursue it as a career.
                  <br>
                  Morpho is known for his dark, atmospheric renders and his innovative use of technology in his art. Interest in traditional painting and digital apps has led him to develop his own unique style of art. He is constantly exploring new ways to improve his craft and is always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what is possible.
                  <br>
                  Currently working on developing a procedural system, by complex intertwined and connected wires, that will allow him to create even more realistic and lifelike 3D models.
